        Behind the scene 
        =================
        First of all when the page loads, browser reads the h1 tag inside the root div
        and it see Veshal is here inside the h1 tag. then it prints, veshal is here,
        but after moving down it goes to the script it will loads react, then it will load
        react dom into the app, then it will go to the script file, app.js and it will load 
        the script file it will execute the code enteres in there and render the things that 
        written there in the root div. It will replace, not append, it will replace the root div.
    -->
    <div id="root">
        <!-- here if i write anything inside the root tag, it will replaced by the root.render tag in the app.js  -->

        <h1>Veshal is Here!</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- And i found one more thing, if i give the cdn for product, in the console, there is no error, but if i am using then
    normal cdn, it is showing error, like unique key  -->
